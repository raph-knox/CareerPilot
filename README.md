# 🎓 Course Recommendation System for Secondary School Students

This project is a web-based **Course Recommendation Platform** that helps Nigerian secondary school students identify the best courses to study at the university level. The system uses students' **JAMB scores** and **WAEC grades** to recommend courses that align with their academic strengths.

## 🚀 Features

- 📝 Input form for JAMB score and WAEC subject grades
- 🤖 Smart algorithm to match students with suitable courses
- 🎯 Accurate recommendations based on academic performance
- 👨‍🎓 Supports different academic paths (Science, Arts, Commercial)
- 📊 Real-time feedback and suggestions

## 💡 How It Works

1. The student visits the website.
2. They enter their JAMB score and their WAEC grades for each subject.
3. A custom-built algorithm evaluates the data.
4. The platform returns a list of recommended university courses tailored to their strengths.
